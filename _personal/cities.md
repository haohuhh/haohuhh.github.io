"Parking Lot - 2018"

Shot at my hometown, Jiangxi, China. It's used to be the most populated area with multiple hotels and state own enterprises' dormitories. Now everything is removed due to city expanding plan and agglomeration. It's a free parking lot now.

"Long Live Mao - 2017"

Shot at my high school classmate, friend's hometown, Jiangxi, China. It is a local reservoir built decades ago, and is no longer the water source but a "natural" swimming spot for rurual kids. Below the red star said "Long Live President Mao", the other two columns cannot be distinguished, but most likely a couplet about the secenary and revolution.
