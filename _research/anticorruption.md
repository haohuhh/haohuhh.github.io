*"Will corruption's effect be transmitted through connections differently?"*

Abstract
------
Given one official from the 2002-2012 pool, we constructed his network of previous coworkers and supervisors. Using the constructed networks, we found that anti-corruption reporting of his coworkers limited his jurisdictionâ€™s economic performance, including investment and revenue of local above-scale enterprises. Such impact is persistent when the cases are reported from another province. For former supervisors reported, the impact is limited inside the same province while interprovincial impact is weak.
