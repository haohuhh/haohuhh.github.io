*"When political attitude becomes liability, will it be transmitted intergenerationally?*

Abstract
------
The relationships between intrinsic traits intergenerational transmission and political institution is important to political economics of social interaction. Will political reform change such transmission mechanism within families? I use the variation of mortality during the great famine and cultural revolution to identify how the exposure to different political environment in China during and after the extreme 'great leap forward' movement can influence political attitude transmission within families. I found that severity of famine weaken the direct political attitude transmission between parents and offspring; in families whose parents are better educated, the weakening effect is stronger; given higher education level, parents would intentionally cut off the transmission within families. Robustness check and mechanism of education opportunity support the conclusion. Using a theoretical model, I also identify that this effect is due to the reduction in ‘ideological penalty’ and a more inclusive institution after the political reform.
